# Deniz Kusefoglu


I'm an infrastructure engineer with experience building, maintaining, and optimizing internet-scale distributed systems under heavy load with high availability requirements. I believe that building a thriving team is the best way to deliver results and ship the right thing fast in a hypergrowth environment. Iâ€™ve worked as a Manager and as an IC, and Iâ€™m looking to work as an IC in my next role.

## ðŸ’»  Experience


**Engineering Manager - Edge Metadata Team** @ [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/) _(January 2023 - January 2024)_ <br>
 - Led an infrastructure migration project on the hotpath of every request to Vercel. Reduced the cost of metadata storage four fold while halving p50 and p99 latencies. 
- Delivered a multi-quarter project successfully and on time as the manager of a previously struggling team. 
- Drove difficult cost/latency tradeoff decisions by identifying clear metrics and running lean experiments. Represented our strategy and team to leadership.  
- Led quarterly planning and prioritization cycles. 
- Trained interviewers on a new hiring pipeline and successfully hired one new infrastructure engineer.

**Senior Software Engineer - Cloud Infrastructure Team** @ [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/) _(October 2021 - January 2023)_ <br>
 - Developed and managed a Global Content Delivery Network responsible for serving on the order of 150K requests per second for many of the worldâ€™s most well known brands.
- Broke out core features of our system from a monolith to microservices in Go, allowing us to horizontally scale resources for previously bottlenecked workloads and improving latencies while keeping costs in check.  
- Lowered our time to first byte p50 latencies by a quarter and p99 latencies four-fold by collecting the right metrics and driving architecture optimizations across the stack.
- Solved dozens of incidents on the front line as Vercelâ€™s incoming request volume scaled 10x. Drove post-incident response to find big picture solutions and lower our incident rate. 
- Reduced developer time required for deployment release cycles by improving the reliability of tests and automating key parts of the deployment process. This project allowed our team to ship code many times a day with confidence and drastically improved iteration velocity. 
 - Mentored and upleveled junior engineers, created onboarding resources.

**Senior Software Engineer - Infrastructure Team** @ [InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/) _(Sept 2017 - October 2021)_ <br>
- InfluxData maintains the InfluxDB Cloud Platform and open source time-series database.
- Created software deployment pipelines for product engineers in our multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) multi-region Kubernetes clusters. 
- Designed and built a new serverless InfluxDB query product, working closely with product team and customers to iterate on user experience and implementation
- Eliminated feature drift between services by automating the end-to-end API contract testing framework for our CI/CD pipeline. 
- Built services in Go to server our APIs for the new InfluxDB Cloud Platform product.
- Developed the open-source data visualization and UI platform [Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf) on the frontend team.
- Specced, designed and built major product features such as â€˜sample dataâ€™ which allowed users to demo our product, and â€˜templatesâ€™, for import and export-able resources within our product. 
- Implemented the Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for InfluxDB's data scripting and query language [flux](https://www.influxdata.com/products/flux/).
- Presented new product features at InfluxDays SF 2019 [Monitoring & Alerting with InfluxDB 2.0](https://youtu.be/H1iWsrDk5VY?t=1013)
