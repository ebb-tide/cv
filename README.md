I work on the deployments team at InfluxData. My work includes ensuring that our software is rolling out continuously on our clusters across the globe, and building tools to empower internal teams to build, test, and deploy our software. I used to work on the UI team, creating user interfaces and tools for data visualization. As a senior engineer, some of my proudest work has been in organizational communication and coordination of work across teams. I'm excited about the future of programming interfaces: in 2016 I studied this and more at The Recurse Center. I have been a student of Mathematics and Neuroscience - and one of my papers was once published in the journal Neuron.
